# CIS-3715-Final-Project

Final Project for Temple Universities 'Principles of Data Science' Course

Used a dataset from Kaggle where an unidentified US company anonymously provided a dataset with over 10,000 records
of employees and encouraged third-party analysis in an attempt to find correlations between the
given factors and employee retention. The data consists of a variety of variables and statistics
about an employeeâ€™s history in the company and their decision to stay or leave. The dataset
provided had about a 70% retention rate, lower than the recommended 90% rate, so this
company was correct to be looking for ways to improve its retention.

Implemented a variety of models to try and find correlation between certain factors and employee retention,
in order to try and give this company a predictive model to increase employee retention. Models used included 
Logistic Regression, KNN, and Clustering.

More details about the approach and results can be found in the report in this repository.
